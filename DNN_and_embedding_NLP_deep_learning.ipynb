        "The goal is to provide an example of NLP classification in the form of sentiment\n",

        "- embedding\n",

        "\n",
        "## Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "Text often contains unecessary information or things we want to mofidy.  A common preprocessing setps is to remove punctuation and lower casing. Removing stop words is another common steps. Stop words are wors that are not useful in the process of classification (the or is for instance in English).\n",
        "The preprocess stepts vary and can be  define before the text vectorization or as part of the vectorization. If it is done as part of the vectorization, we can pass a function or set specific parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Vectorization\n",
        "\n",
        "Before using any ML method, we must first convert the text into numerical values. This is the process of tokenization or vectorization. We can choose different levels for the tokens of the text: characters, words or sentences. In this exercise, we will use word tokenization and will explore sentence tokenization later.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of this step is typically tensor/matrix with document in the row and tokens as columns. There are multiple variation of the matrix (count, frequency, tfidf). In the case of one hot encoding vectorization, the matrix shows the presence of a token for a document. In the case of the frequency count vectorization matrix, it shows the frequency of each words in a document. In most cases, the matrix/tensor is usually sparse and is processed to reduce its dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Embedding provides a way to represent text using continuous vector values. It can represent tokens relationship or semantic relations in more efficient way. Vectorization can produce very large sparse and embedding provides more useful ways to represent words in reduced size space. Example of typical embedding include Wordtovect and GLOVE. These embeddings were created on very large text dataset and often called pre-trained embedding space. In this exercise, we create our own embedding layer in the deep learning model using the text corpus we have.\n",
        "\n",
        "The text vectorization and embedding steps are sometimes called encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dense Neural Network: features and classification\n",
        "\n",
        "Embedding layers will feed into intermediary layers that will create features of relevance to the classification. This usually called the feature extractor (backbone) of the DL neural network. The top or head of the network contains the classifier: the neural network corresponding to a binary or multiple category classification.\n",

        "In this exercise, we use the Twitter US airline sentiment dataset. It is a public dataset published used in the Kaggle competition published in 2015. It contains about 16k reviews classified into three sentiment categories: negative, neutral and positive.\n",
