        "# Introduction to topic modeling with DL\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, I explore topic modeling with transfer learning applied to NLP. The goal is to show how to leverage pre-trained models in clustering for topic modeling. As we saw before, topic modeling is a form of unsupervised modeling with the goal of clustering similar samples (documents) together to form groups. The groups of documents are then labeled using their properties/attributes. In this particular case, clusters of text documents can be labeledu using by extracting topics from the clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, we reproduce/develop a methodology similar to BertTopic and Top2vec that leverages pre-trained embedding DL models.  We use the 20newsgroup dataset which is a benchmark dataset used in text classification to assess the quality of the topic modeling method. Instead of using the labels from the 20 newsdataset, we cluster the samples/documents. We can then compare the clusters to the labeled classes. The general step by step workflow is as follow:\n",
        "\n",
        "- embedding: BERT/sentence encoding or Universal Sentence Encoder\n",
        "- dimension reduction: UMAP\n",
        "- clustering: HDBSCAN\n",
        "- labeling: cluster tf-idf\n",
        "\n",
        "We describe in more details the various steps below.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Text must be tokenized: turn words or sentences into a numerical format before performing any modeling.\n",
        "We used a pre-trained embedding model to convert our text into a vector space. For this exercise, we use Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) from tensforflow hub. The output of the encoder is a 512 dimensional vector space. The 512 vector space correspond to a feature space maps the meanings and semantic relationship between words or sentences in the input corpus dataset it was trained on. Since, USE was trained on a large general text dataset it captures general semantic relationship between words in the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dimension reduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The embedding creates a very large encoding of text and this high dimension is often problematic for clustering algorithms. To reduce the dimension of the embedding there are multiple existing methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Recent literature has shown that UMAP works well and has less constraints than PCA. As is done in BerTopic and Top2vec, we use UMAP to reduce the dimension of the feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Clustering\n",
        "\n",
        "Text clustering is the process of grouping similar text samples together. There are different algorithms available such as Kmeans and/or DSBCAN. In this exercise, we use HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). HDBSCAN is is a variant of DSBCAN that consider multiple spatial scales in the clustering. The algorithm does not require any assumption (spherical cluster like Kmeans for instance) as is robust to outliers/noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Labeling\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the groups or clusters have beeen create, we have to label each group with a topic based on its characteristic. There are multiple strategies available:\n",
        "- extract topics using word occurence or tf-idf of clusters\n",
        "- extract topics based on the closeness to the mean vector or centroid of the clsuters.\n",
        "\n",
        "We explore cluster tf-idf and centroid based topic vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "The 20newsgroup dataset is a popular benchmark dataset used in NLP. It was originally used in a publication by Ken Lang published in 1995. It was later made available in kaggle and other repositories. It contains almost 20,000 newsgroup documents labeled as 20 topics.\n",

        "\n",
        "USE embedding produces a 512 feature space which is very large to use in a cluster algorithm.  We use Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to reduce the embedding space. UMAP will provide both a way to reduce dimension for data visualization and enhanced clustering of text into different groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "UMAP is a recent dimension reduction technique published in 2015 that performs well compared to PCA and tSNE. It is non linear in nature and takes into account neighbour structure. It is made available through a python package called UMAP.\n",
        "\n",
        "When running UMAP, we need to consider the following four major input parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "- n_neighbors: this parameter determines the size of the neighborood to consider in estimating the manifold. Larger values will result in more global structure versus more local structure for lower values. The default value is 15.\n",
        "\n",
        "- n_components: number of output dimensions to retain in the UMAP dimension reduction. The default value is 2 but UMAP scales well and one can choose higher dimension embedding if used for clustering rather than visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- min_dist: this parameters controls how points may be clumped together. It defines a minimum distance between points to be considered in the estimation of the manifold embedding. Lower values will look at closer points and finer structure/detail in the manifold. Larger values will include more far away points and larger/more global structure in the manifold so larger structure in the embedding (dimension reduction). The default value is 0.1.\n",
        "\n",
        "- metric: distance measurement used in UMAP. UMAP provides a wide range of metrics from Euclidean, Minkowski, cosine, correlation, haversine (for spatial data) etc. The default metric is Eucldidean.\n",

The ICCCM specifies how the app should set its title, so the wm is obliged to do it.  If this bothers you, complain to the app writer.\\n\\n\\nWrite your own wm that doesn't support the ICCCM.  Or write an program that you give a window ID and a title.  The your program can set the windows title for the app and then if the app changes it, your program switches it back again.\\n\\n   \n",

This function could generate cluster ID and provide diagnostic as well a potential labels (extracted from c-TFidf). This function could then compared to the BERTopic algorithm provided in the package. We will be adding this improvement in later iterations of this lab/exercise."
